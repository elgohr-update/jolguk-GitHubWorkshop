# GitHub Actions Workshop by Charlene

In this workshop you will create a GitHub workflow from scratch to build, test and deploy a .NET Core container image to a private container registry in Azure. 

You will then enable continuous deployment on a Web App, so that whenever changes are made to source code, these are automatically deployed to the web app.

The architecture looks like this:
